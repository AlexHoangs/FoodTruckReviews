# FoodTruckReviews

This project was created to help me be more familiar with android development. 
I was also experiencing the problem of not knowing which days each food trucks came to campus.
What better way to solve this problem by not creating an android applciation with a list of all the footrucks available
as well as their respective menus? Not only the list view of the contents of each foodtruck, but also a tab to view the
reviews left by other students! 

• Created user interactive android application by fetching data from local food trucks web API (food trucks at UC Davis).
• Implemented authentication with back-end server using ID tokens and Google’s login API.
• Allowed authenticated users to view/post reviews about each food truck after logging into their Google account.
• Designed tab layout to switch between menu and reviews and cached data using Room database for offline use.
